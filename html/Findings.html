            Before the project I did have some experience of using VR and
            related technology but still have no idea about MR and what’s the
            difference between MR and AR. Two technology looks simliar.

            After experiencing the MR by myself, I was amazed by MR about its
            concept to blend virtual and real world together and realized AR is
            just adding a virtual layer on real world but MR is more advanced by
            combining VR and AR together.

            I have no ideas about how to experience the MR(Mixed Reality) world.
            Does it connect the real world and the virtual world?

            Experiencing the MRC requires users to have the VR headset while
            selecting the suitable platform. Meta quest is a common platform
            connecting the Mixed Reality scene from the virtual world to the
            real world. Users can interact with the virtual world by using the
            headset and controllers to have an immersive experience.

            The concept of Mixed reality deeply fascinates me. Being able to
            enhance the “reality experience” using "not real" objects blows my
            mind. But I never knew the details behind the fancy term of Mixed
            reality.

            After this project, with access to the equipment in the CS lab and
            the research our group did, not only did I know more about the
            technical details of Mixed Reality, but I also discovered that mixed
            reality is not only an enhancement in daily life entertainment but
            also will be a revolutionary in the workforce. This project led me
            to explore more about MR, and fell more deeply in love with it.

            I didn't know what mixed reality was. I think it is about vr or
            something like vr. I don't know how it works.

            I know more about mixed reality. It is complex for me, because I
            don’t know much about computers and the techniques. However, I know
            that many things involve mixed reality and I didn’t know before.
            After I tried to play the vr, I think it is interesting and fun.
